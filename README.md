# Simple Calculator

Welcome to this little project. I'm not expert at all, but I'm learning C to become a better version of myself. In case somebody actually would like to test my project, I recommend to install Nix to test this program.

## Enable the environment

Once you have installed Nix, open the folder project, open your console on there and then type:
```sh
nix-shell
```

## Test the program

If you just wanna build and run the program automatically, then just type on your terminal:
```sh
make
```

To just build the program, then type:
```sh
make build
```

To just run the program (you should have compiled it before), then type:
```sh
make run
```

**Thanks for reading! Sincerely, Edu.**
